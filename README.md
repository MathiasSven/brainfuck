# Brainfuck Interpreter, REPL, JIT & ~~Compiler~~

A brainfuck parser/interpreter.

For REPL, use `bfrun repl`.

JIT Interpretation is also available, however it is not fully functioning. There are some bugs around reading from `stdin`.

The compiler has many outstanding bugs, doesn't work for anything but the most simple brainfuck scripts.
