# Brainfuck Interpreter, JIT & ~~Compiler~~

A super simple brainfuck parser/interpreter.

JIT Interpretation is also available, however it is not fully functioning. There are some bugs around reading from `stdin`.

The compiler has many outstanding bugs, doesn't work for anything but the most simple brainfuck scripts.
